{
	"type": "display",
	"line1": "********************",
	"line2": "********************",
	"line3": "********************",

To Do's
Harmonize the two devices (they have pins difs)
Maybe make the display more graphical and fun

the topics should be sometihng like /trains/display/*stationname*/*tracknumber* if you want to get fancy.
